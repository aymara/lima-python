TL;DR
=====

LIMA python bindings are currently available **under Linux only** (x86_64).

Under Linux with python >= 3.7 and < 4, and **upgraded pip**:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Upgrading pip is fundamental in order to obtain the correct LIMA version
   $ pip install --upgrade pip
   $ pip install aymara==0.4.2
   $ lima_models.py -i eng
   $ python

.. code-block:: bash

   >>> import aymara.lima
   >>> lima = aymara.lima.Lima("ud-eng")
   >>> doc = lima('Hello, World!')
   >>> print(doc[0].lemma)
   hello
   >>> print(repr(doc))
   # sent_id = 1
   # text = Hello, World!
   1       Hello   hello   INTJ    _       _               0       root      _ Len=5|Pos=1|SpaceAfter=No

Introducing LIMA
================

LIMA is a multilingual linguistic analyzer developed by the `CEA LIST <http://www-list.cea.fr/en>`_, `LASTI laboratory <http://www.kalisteo.fr/en/index.htm>`_ (French acronym for Text and Image Semantic Analysis Laboratory). LIMA is Free Software, available under the MIT license.

LIMA has `state of the art performance for more than 60 languages <https://github.com/aymara/lima-models/blob/master/eval.md>`_ thanks to its recent deep learning (neural network) based modules. But it includes also a very powerful rules based mechanism called ModEx allowing to quickly extract information (entities, relations, eventsâ€¦) in new domains where annotated data does not exist.

For more information, installation instructions and documentation, please refer to `the LIMA Wiki <https://github.com/aymara/lima/wiki>`_.
