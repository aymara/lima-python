# LIMA python bindings

## Introducing LIMA

LIMA is a multilingual linguistic analyzer developed by the [CEA LIST](http://www-list.cea.fr/en), [LASTI laboratory](http://www.kalisteo.fr/en/index.htm) (French acronym for Text and Image Semantic Analysis Laboratory). LIMA is Free Software, available under the MIT license.

LIMA has [state of the art performance for more than 60 languages](https://github.com/aymara/lima-models/blob/master/eval.md) thanks to its recent deep learning (neural network) based modules. But it includes also a very powerful rules based mechanism called ModEx allowing to quickly extract information (entities, relations, eventsâ€¦) in new domains where annotated data does not exist.

For more information, detailed installation instructions and documentation, please refer to [the LIMA Wiki](https://github.com/aymara/lima/wiki).


## Installation

LIMA python bindings are currently available **under Linux only** (x86_64).

Under Linux with python >= 3.7 and < 4, and **upgraded pip**:


```bash
# Upgrading pip is fundamental in order to obtain the correct LIMA version
$ pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip install aymara==0.5.0b6
$ lima_models.py -l eng
# Either simply use the lima command to produce an analysis of a file in CoNLLU format:
$ lima <path to the file to analyse>
# Or use the python API:
$ python
>>> import aymara.lima
>>> nlp = aymara.lima.Lima("ud-eng")
>>> doc = nlp('Hello, World!')
>>> print(doc[0].lemma)
hello
>>> print(repr(doc))
1       Hello   hello   INTJ    _       _               0       root    _       Pos=0|Len=5
2       ,       ,       PUNCT   _       _               1       punct   _       Pos=5|Len=1
3       World   World   PROPN   _       Number:Sing     1       vocative        _       Pos=7|Len=5
4       !       !       PUNCT   _       _               1       punct   _       Pos=12|Len=1
```

To use the deeplima pipelines (improved but experimental), you will have to
install with both `lima_models` and `deeplima_models`. Check the [user manual](https://github.com/aymara/lima/wiki/LIMA-Python-User-Manual) for more information about using these models.

## Running


```python
$ lima <utf-8 text file to analyze>
# OR
$ python
Python 3.8.10 (default, Nov 26 2021, 20:14:08)
[GCC 9.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import aymara.lima
>>> l = aymara.lima.Lima("ud-eng")
>>> r = l.analyzeText("The author wrote a novel.", lang="ud-eng")
>>> print(r)
# sent_id = 1
# text = The author wrote a novel.
1       The     the     DET     _       Definite=Def|PronType=Art       2       det     _       Len=3|Pos=1
2       author  author  NOUN    _       Number=Sing     3       nsubj   _       Len=6|Pos=5
3       wrote   write   VERB    _       Mood=Ind|Tense=Past|VerbForm=Fin        0       root    _       Len=5|Pos=12
4       a       a       DET     _       Definite=Ind|PronType=Art       5       det     _       Len=1|Pos=18
5       novel   novel   NOUN    _       Number=Sing     3       obj     _       Len=5|Pos=20|SpaceAfter=No
6       .       .       PUNCT   _       _       3       punct   _       Len=1|Pos=25

>>>
```

Note that some error messages could be displayed during the Lima object instantiation. If you get a valid result, you can ignore them. Most of them are debug messages that will be removed in a later version.

You can replace the language (`ud-eng`) used by `eng` to use the legacy pipeline. This is the same for `ud-fra` and `fre`. Note that legacy pipelines do not use the Universal Dependencies tagset, but a proprietary one.


## Python bindings API documentation

The Lima python API documentation is [on readthedocs](https://lima-python.readthedocs.io/en/port-to-qt6/).

## Configuration and customization

To configure finely LIMA for your needs, follow the same instructions as for the native C++ tools, available here: [[https://github.com/aymara/lima/wiki/LIMA-User-Manual]].


# PySide LIMA python bindings build and deploy instructions

## Building the wheel

Use docker using the `gbuild-manylinux_2_28.sh` script:

```bash
./gbuild-manylinux_2_28.sh
```

## Deploying the wheel

Use Twine (`pip install twine`) to deploy the whell to PyPI with the help of the `deploy-manylinux_2_28.sh` script.

```bash
./deploy-manylinux_2_28.sh
```

# Developper Notes
To see the wheels accepted on current system:

```
>>> from packaging.tags import sys_tags
>>> [str(t) for t in sys_tags()]
```
