# LIMA python bindings

## Introducing LIMA

LIMA is a multilingual linguistic analyzer developed by the [CEA LIST](http://www-list.cea.fr/en), [LASTI laboratory](http://www.kalisteo.fr/en/index.htm) (French acronym for Text and Image Semantic Analysis Laboratory). LIMA is Free Software, available under the MIT license.

LIMA has [state of the art performance for more than 60 languages](https://github.com/aymara/lima-models/blob/master/eval.md) thanks to its recent deep learning (neural network) based modules. But it includes also a very powerful rules based mechanism called ModEx allowing to quickly extract information (entities, relations, eventsâ€¦) in new domains where annotated data does not exist.

For more information, detailed installation instructions and documentation, please refer to [the LIMA Wiki](https://github.com/aymara/lima/wiki).


## Installation

LIMA python bindings are currently available for python >= 3.7 and < 4, under Linux. Install with:

```bash
$ pip install --upgrade pip # IMPORTANT: LIMA needs a recent pip
$ pip install aymara
```

You can use it like that in English (eng) or French (fre) but it is preferable to use deep-learning based models. To install them, use the `lima_models.py` script:

```bash
$ lima_models.py -h
usage: lima_models.py [-h] [-i] [-l LANG] [-d DEST] [-s SELECT] [-f] [-L]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i, --info            print list of available languages and exit
  -l LANG, --lang LANG  install model for the given language name or language code (example: 'english'
                        or 'eng')
  -d DEST, --dest DEST  destination directory
  -s SELECT, --select SELECT
                        select particular models to install: tokenizer, morphosyntax, lemmatizer
                        (comma-separated list)
  -f, --force           force reinstallation of existing files
  -L, --list            list installed models
```

For example:
```bash
$ lima_models.py -l eng
```

## Running


```python
$ python

>>> import aymara.lima
>>> l = aymara.lima.Lima("ud-eng")
>>> r = l.analyzeText("The author wrote a novel.", lang="ud-eng")
>>> print(r)
# sent_id = 1
# text = The author wrote a novel.

>>>
```

Note that some error messages could be displayed during the Lima object instantiation. If you get a valid result, you can ignore them. Most of them are debug messages that will be removed in a later version.

You can replace the language (`ud-eng`) used by `eng` to use the legacy pipeline. This is the same for `ud-fra` and `fre`. Note that legacy pipelines do not use the Universal Dependencies tagset, but a proprietary one.

## Configuration and customization

To configure finely LIMA for your needs, follow the same instructions as for the native C++ tools, available here: [[https://github.com/aymara/lima/wiki/LIMA-User-Manual]].


# PySide LIMA python bindings build and deploy instructions

## Building the wheel

Use docker using the `gbuild-manylinux_2_28.sh` script:

```bash
./gbuild-manylinux_2_28.sh.sh
```

## Deploying the wheel

Use Twine (`pip install twine`) to deploy the whell to PyPI with the help of the `deploy.sh` script.

```bash
./deploy-manylinux_2_28.sh
```

# Developper Notes
To see the wheels accepted on current system:

```
>>> from packaging.tags import sys_tags
>>> [str(t) for t in sys_tags()]
```
